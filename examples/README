These examples exist to show off what LaTeX can do.

What is presented here is out of the scope of a talk given to beginners. It is
instead intended to show the audience the potential of LaTeX as motivation to
learn how to use it.

These consist primarily of old assignments, papers, and tech reports I have
written.
